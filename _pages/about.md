I obtained his bachelor’s degree in computer science and technology and master’s degree in computer applied technology from Northwest A&F University, China. Afterwards, I completed his PhD with [A/Prof Ashley Buckle](http://www.med.monash.edu.au/biochem/staff/abuckle.html) and [Dr Jiangning Song](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/jiangning-song) at the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University in 2016, where I focused on developing bioinformatic algorithms and databases for analysing the relationship between protein structure, function and disease. After completing my PhD study, I moved to the laboratories of [Prof Anthony Purcell](http://www.med.monash.edu.au/biochem/staff/purcell.html) and [Prof Jian Li](https://www.monash.edu/pharm/research/areas/drug-delivery/labs/li-lab) at the Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute as a research bioinformatician, and have since extended his research into proteomics and immunopeptidomics.

I am now working jointly in the [Aebersold Lab](http://www.imsb.ethz.ch/research/aebersold.html) at ETH Zurich and the [Purcell Lab](http://www.med.monash.edu.au/biochem/staff/purcell.html) at Monash University as a CJ Martin Early Career Research Fellow supported by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council ([NHMRC](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/)). His research focuses on integrating proteomics and immunopeptidomics to understand prostate cancer carcinogenesis, diagnosis and treatment.

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
