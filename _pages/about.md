I obtained his bachelor’s degree in computer science and technology and master’s degree in computer applied technology from Northwest A&F University, China. Afterwards, I completed his PhD with [A/Prof Ashley Buckle](http://www.med.monash.edu.au/biochem/staff/abuckle.html) and [Dr Jiangning Song](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/jiangning-song) at the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University in 2016, where I focused on developing bioinformatic algorithms and databases for analysing the relationship between protein structure, function and disease. After completing my PhD study, I moved to the laboratories of [Prof Anthony Purcell](http://www.med.monash.edu.au/biochem/staff/purcell.html) and [Prof Jian Li](https://www.monash.edu/pharm/research/areas/drug-delivery/labs/li-lab) at the Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute as a research bioinformatician, and have since extended his research into proteomics and immunopeptidomics.

I am now working jointly in the [Aebersold Lab](http://www.imsb.ethz.ch/research/aebersold.html) at ETH Zurich and the [Purcell Lab](http://www.med.monash.edu.au/biochem/staff/purcell.html) at Monash University as a CJ Martin Early Career Research Fellow supported by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council ([NHMRC](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/)). My research focuses on integrating proteomics and immunopeptidomics to understand prostate cancer carcinogenesis, diagnosis and treatment.
